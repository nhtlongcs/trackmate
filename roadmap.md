### **Proposal for "TrackMate" as an AI Finance Agent**

**TrackMate** will now evolve into a conversational AI finance assistant, capable of understanding natural language queries, interacting via chat, and autonomously creating, reading, updating, and deleting records in Google Sheets based on user instructions. By eliminating the need for specific commands, TrackMate will provide a seamless and intuitive user experience.

### **Example Use Cases**  

1. **Adding Expenses:**  
   - User: "I spent $25 on groceries yesterday."  
   - TrackMate: "Got it! Adding $25 to the Groceries category for yesterday. Does that look right?"  

2. **Viewing Data:**  
   - User: "How much did I spend on dining out this month?"  
   - TrackMate: "You’ve spent $120 on dining out so far this month."  

3. **Updating Records:**  
   - User: "Change the $15 I logged for transport to groceries."  
   - TrackMate: "Updated the $15 entry from Transport to Groceries."  

4. **Proactive Alerts:**  
   - TrackMate: "You’ve already spent 80% of your entertainment budget this month. Keep an eye on your spending!"

### **Key Features**  

1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**  
   - Leverage AI models (e.g., OpenAI GPT or similar) to process and interpret user queries.  
   - Understand diverse ways of phrasing requests (e.g., "Add a lunch expense for $15 today" or "Show me my spending this week").  

2. **Autonomous CRUD Operations:**  
   - Automatically translate user instructions into CRUD actions for Google Sheets.  
   - Perform operations like adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting expenses without explicit commands.  

3. **Interactive Chat-Based Interface:**  
   - Respond conversationally to user inputs on Telegram.  
   - Ask clarifying questions if the user's query is ambiguous.

4. **Smart Categorization:**  
   - Use AI to auto-categorize expenses based on receipt details or context provided by the user.  
   - Suggest categories if a user’s input is unclear (e.g., "Is this for Food or Transportation?").  

5. **Analytics and Insights:**  
   - Generate conversational insights (e.g., "You spent 20% more on groceries this month than last month").  
   - Answer questions like "What’s my biggest expense category this month?" or "How much did I spend last weekend?"  

6. **Receipt Scanning with OCR:**  
   - Extract information (date, amount, category) from uploaded images and confirm the data with the user.  

7. **Personalized Recommendations:**  
   - Provide tailored tips for saving based on spending habits.  
   - Alert users about unusual spending patterns or nearing budget limits.  

8. **Proactive Engagement:**  
   - Send reminders about tracking expenses or staying within budget.  
   - Notify users when new data insights are available.
